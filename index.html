    <p>Public safety is of the utmost concern for most of the population. Unfortunately, there are safety concerns that the members of the public must be aware of in order to keep themselves safe. The <a href="hhttps://www.fbi.gov">Federal Bureau of Investigation</a> compiles thousands of data sets each year about the number and types of crimes per region, state and county.
